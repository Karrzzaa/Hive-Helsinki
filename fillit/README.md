# fillit

Goal for this project was to create a program that takes a text file with 1-26 tetriminos,
checks that the file is and tetriminos are valid and then places them in smallest possible square in alphabetical order,
or as close alphabetical order as possible, since 1st priority is to have them in smallest possible square.
