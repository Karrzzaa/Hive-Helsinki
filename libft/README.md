# libft

This project was our first actual project after going through some of the stuff we did during our piscine in piscine_reloaded.
As we are not allowed to use many pre-existing fucntions from c libraries, we created library with the same functions to better
understand how they work and also for us to use later on in harder and larger projects. I will be adding more functions here as I progress
and come up with something new and useful.
