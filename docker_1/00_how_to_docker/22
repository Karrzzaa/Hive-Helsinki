# to add worker you need token from swarm creation and manager machines ip

#	docker swarm join-token worker -q
#	docker-machine ip Char

# copy the whole line
# to change to Aiur:

#	docker-machine env Aiur
#	eval $(docker-machine env Aiur)

# now we can execute the following command with correct token and ip to add Aiur as worker

#	docker swarm join --token <token> <ip>:2377

# or from manager machine with one command:

docker-machine ssh Aiur "docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token worker -q) $(docker-machine ip Char):2377"
